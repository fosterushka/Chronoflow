Code of Conduct for Contributors

Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to create a collaborative and
professional environment where contributions are accompanied by clear
documentation, descriptive branch names, and adherence to project guidelines,
ensuring that our project remains accessible and easy to maintain.

Our Standards

To ensure the quality and sustainability of the project, contributors are
expected to:

1. Document Every Function

   •	Provide a clear and concise explanation of each function you create or
   modify. •	Include: •	Purpose: What the function does. •	Parameters: Expected
   input values and their types. •	Return Value: The output of the function and
   its type. •	Usage Example: How the function is used (optional but
   encouraged).

2. Use Descriptive Branch Names

All branches must follow a naming convention that clearly communicates the
purpose of the changes. The format should include: •	Type of change (prefix):
•	feat/ for new features. •	hotfix/ for critical fixes in production. •	bugfix/
for fixing bugs. •	enhc/ for enhancements or improvements. •	doc/ for
documentation updates. •	Description: Briefly describe the change. •	Release
Name/Version: (if applicable).

Examples:

    •	feat/user-authentication-v1.2
    •	hotfix/payment-processing-bug
    •	bugfix/login-page-redirect
    •	enhc/ui-theme-update
    •	doc/add-api-docs-v1.0

3. Maintain Consistent Documentation Style

   •	Follow the existing documentation standards of the project. If unclear,
   reach out to maintainers for clarification.

4. Write Readable and Understandable Code

   •	Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. •	Avoid overly
   complex logic unless necessary and document it thoroughly.

Unacceptable Behavior

The following actions are violations of the Code of Conduct: •	Submitting
branches with unclear or non-descriptive names. •	Submitting functions without
documentation. •	Ignoring or dismissing feedback on branch names, documentation,
or coding standards. •	Repeatedly failing to adhere to documentation or code
quality guidelines.

Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors to this project, in all spaces
where the project is discussed or worked on (e.g., repository discussions, issue
threads, and pull requests).

Enforcement

Instances of non-compliance with this Code of Conduct will be handled as
follows:

1. First Violation:

   •	A friendly reminder will be issued to correct branch names, add
   documentation, or follow other guidelines.

2. Second Violation:

   •	A formal warning will be issued, and the contributor’s pull request may be
   put on hold until corrections are made.

3. Further Violations:

   •	The contributor’s pull requests may be denied, and their ability to
   contribute may be restricted.

Examples of Proper Function Documentation

```ts
/**
 * Represents a User object with basic details.
 */
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

/**
 * Creates a welcome message for a user.
 *
 * @param user - An object containing the user's information.
 * @returns A personalized welcome message.
 *
 * @example
 * const user: User = { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' };
 * const message = createWelcomeMessage(user);
 * // Returns: "Welcome, John Doe! Your email is john.doe@example.com."
 */
function createWelcomeMessage(user: User): string {
  return `Welcome, ${user.name}! Your email is ${user.email}.`;
}
```
